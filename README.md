# 42_CPP08
 This module focuses on advanced C++ concepts using the STL, such as containers, templates, iterators, and algorithms. The exercises involve implementing a function to find integers in containers, designing a class to compute spans in a collection of integers, and extending a stack to support iteration with iterators.
